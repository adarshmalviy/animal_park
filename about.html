								<b>My name is Raksha Malviya from St. Thomas School, Gynapur, recently in 10th Standard. I would also like to thank my school principal Mr. Paulson Philip wholeheartedly.I must also thank my parents and friends for the immense support and help during this project. Without their help, completing this project would have been very difficult.

							<h3>About My school</h3>
							<p>
								<b><a href="http://stthomasgyanpur.com/Default.aspx">ST. THOMAS SCHOOL, GYANPUR</a> is an English Medium Co-Educational School affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education in New Delhi. Rev. K.V. Abraham, President of the New Life League, created the school. Gyanpur, the district seat of Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh, is home to the school. Our school has evolved from a small beginning in April 1988 to a fully integrated institution that educates students from nursery to class ten. By serving the people of this region, St. Thomas has gained a reputation for distinction in academics, athletics, and cultural activities, and has become a leading light in education.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our motto "LOVE ONE ANOTHER" declares a compassionate love for God, as expressed in Jesus Christ. Only love can build our nation in justice and truth that respects the dignity of all human beings. Here, the hands and hearts of our staff provide the institution's vision  with lasting commitment and dedication.
